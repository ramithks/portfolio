![Portfolio Preview](public/vite.svg)

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio is not just a showcase of work; it's a demonstration of engineering capability. It features a custom "God Mode" command palette, interactive Terminal simulations, 3D particle systems, and high-performance animations, all wrapped in a minimalist, executive-grade design.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **God Mode Command Palette (`Cmd+K`)**:
    -   **System Failure**: Physics-based gravity simulation.
    -   **Matrix Mode**: Cyberpunk visual inversion.
    -   **Debug Mode**: Wireframe visualizer.
    -   **Void Mode**: Minimalist focus mode.
    -   **Terminal Mode**: Fully functional Mac-style ZSH terminal simulation.
-   **Performance First**: Built with `Vite` for instant HMR and optimized builds.
-   **Micro-Interactions**: Magnetic buttons, tilt-effect cards, and smooth scroll (Lenis).
-   **3D Elements**: WebGL-powered particle systems using `react-three-fiber`.
-   **Executive Design**: "Swiss Grid" layouts, advanced typography, and dark mode aesthetics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Core**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
-   **Styling**: TailwindCSS, PostCSS
-   **Animation**: Framer Motion, GSAP
-   **3D**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei
-   **Utilities**: Lucide React, CMDK, Lenis Scroll
